## Overview
The ChatGPT Arduino Library provides a convenient way to interact with the OpenAI GPT models from Arduino environments, such as ESP32 devices. With this library, you can easily send text and vision queries to the ChatGPT API and receive responses directly in your Arduino projects.

## Features
- **Text Generation**: Generate text-based responses to user queries using the ChatGPT models.
- **Vision Question Answering**: Utilize the vision capabilities of ChatGPT to answer questions about images.
- **Simple API Integration**: Simple and intuitive API for seamless integration into your Arduino projects.

## Authentication
The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. Visit your API Keys page to retrieve the API key you'll use in your requests.

First, get your SECRET KEY issued here.

## Installation

### Using Arduino Library Manager

From Arduino IDE, go to menu *Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries...*
In Library Manager Window, search *"ChatGPT"* in the search form then select *"ChatGPT_Client"*
Click *"Install"* button.

### Manual installation

Download zip file from this repository by selecting the green *"Code"* dropdown at the top of repository, select *"Download ZIP"*
From Arduino IDE, select menu *Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library...*

Or use git:
 ```
 cd ~/arduino/libraries/
 gh repo clone 0015/ChatGPT_Client_For_Arduino
 ```

Then you should see the examples and be able to include the library in your projects with:

```
 #include <ChatGPT.hpp>
```

## Usage
1. Include the `ChatGPT.hpp` header file in your Arduino sketch.
2. Create a `ChatGPT` object and provide your API key and other required parameters.
3. Use the provided methods to send queries to the ChatGPT API and receive responses.

### Example:
```cpp
#include <ChatGPT.hpp>

// Initialize ChatGPT client
WiFiSSLClient wifiClient;
ChatGPT<WiFiSSLClient> chatGPT(&wifiClient, "v1", "YOUR_API_KEY", 10000);

void exampleTextQuestion() {
  /*
  model: Model to use for generating the response (e.g., "gpt-4o", "gpt-3.5-turbo").
  role: Role of the message sender (e.g., "user" or "assistant").
  content: Content of the message to send.
  max_tokens: Maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.
  content_only: Flag indicating whether to extract only the content of the response. (e.g., true - answer only, false - full response)
  result: Reference to a String variable to store the result of the API call.
  */

  String result;
  Serial.println("\n\n[ChatGPT] - Asking a Text Question");
  if (chatGPT_Client.chat_message("gpt-3.5-turbo", "user", "What is the best feature of GPT-4o?", 100, false, result)) {
    Serial.print("[ChatGPT] Response: ");
    Serial.println(result);
  } else {
    Serial.print("[ChatGPT] Error: ");
    Serial.println(result);
  }
}

void exampleVisionQuestionWithURL() {
  /*
  model: Model to use for generating the response (e.g., "gpt-4o").
  role: Role of the message sender (e.g., "user" or "assistant").
  type: Type of content (e.g., "text").
  text: Text content of the message.
  image_type: Type of the image (e.g., "image_url").
  image_url: URL of the image.
  detail: Detail level of the image (e.g., "high", "low", "auto").
  max_tokens: Maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.
  content_only: Flag indicating whether to extract only the content of the response. (e.g., true - answer only, false - full response)
  result: Reference to a String variable to store the result of the API call.
  */
  String result;
  Serial.println("\n\n[ChatGPT] - Asking a Vision Question");
  if (chatGPT_Client.vision_question("gpt-4o", "user", "text", "Whatâ€™s in this image?", "image_url", "https://samplelib.com/lib/preview/jpeg/sample-city-park-400x300.jpg", "auto", 400, false, result)) {
    Serial.print("[ChatGPT] Response: ");
    Serial.println(result);
  } else {
    Serial.print("[ChatGPT] Error: ");
    Serial.println(result);
  }
}
```
